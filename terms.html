    <h1>Scout Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Last updated: January 19, 2026</p>

    <h2>About Scout</h2>
    <p>Scout is an internal desktop application developed by <strong>1st
  Phorm</strong> for use by our social media team. Scout provides a unified
  dashboard for viewing performance metrics across all 1st Phorm social media
  accounts.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>Internal Use Only:</strong> Scout is not available to the general
  public. Access is restricted to authorized 1st Phorm employees.
    </div>

    <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By using Scout, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree,
   do not use the application.</p>

    <h2>Authorized Use</h2>
    <p>Scout is intended solely for legitimate business purposes by authorized
  1st Phorm team members. You agree to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use Scout only for internal analytics and reporting</li>
      <li>Protect any login credentials and access tokens</li>
      <li>Not share access with unauthorized individuals</li>
      <li>Report any security concerns to the development team</li>
      <li>Comply with all applicable laws and platform terms of service</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Scout connects to third-party social media platforms via their official
  APIs, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>TikTok</li>
      <li>YouTube</li>
      <li>Instagram</li>
      <li>Facebook</li>
      <li>Pinterest</li>
      <li>LinkedIn</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your use of these platforms is subject to their respective terms of
  service. Scout accesses only 1st Phorm's owned accounts with proper
  authorization.</p>

    <h2>Data Accuracy</h2>
    <p>Scout displays data retrieved from third-party social media platforms.
  While we strive for accuracy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Metrics may be delayed depending on platform API limitations</li>
      <li>Data may differ slightly from platform-native analytics</li>
      <li>Historical data accuracy depends on sync frequency</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Scout is provided as a convenience tool and should not be the sole source
   for critical business decisions.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>Scout, including its design, code, and content, is the property of 1st
  Phorm. All rights reserved. You may not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Copy, modify, or distribute Scout</li>
      <li>Reverse engineer or attempt to extract source code</li>
      <li>Use Scout branding without permission</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>Scout is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. 1st Phorm shall
   not be liable for any damages arising from the use or inability to use Scout,
   including but not limited to data inaccuracies, service interruptions, or
  third-party API changes.</p>

    <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms of Service as needed. Continued use of Scout
  after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>1st Phorm reserves the right to terminate or suspend access to Scout at
  any time, for any reason, without notice.</p>
